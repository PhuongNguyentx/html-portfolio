<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Dolia, and I have been working as a manual tester for over 11 years. 
  I have a strong background in testing software applications, identifying and reporting issues, 
  and collaborating with developers to ensure that products meet high standards of quality.</p>

<p>When I’m not working, I enjoy spending time in the kitchen cooking up new recipes. 
  I also love to do crafts, such as crocheting and sewing, which I find it to be a great way to unwind and express my creativity.
  One of my long-term goals is to have my own farm and grow my own food. I have always been interested in gardening. 
  And I believe that growing your own food is not only a rewarding experience but also an important step towards a healthy lifestyle.</p>

<p>Overall, I am passionate about applying my skills and knowledge to help create high-quality software products.
  I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate with like-minded individuals who share my interests and goals. 
  Do you enjoy gardening? If yes, please feel free to reach out and let’s chat.
  Looking forward to connecting with you.</p>
